&lt;p>Well, I promised yesterday I&amp;rsquo;d dive into John the Ripper, and holy cow, this tool is both fascinating and terrifying. After spending the last few days learning about hashing theory, getting hands-on with an actual password cracking tool really drove home how vulnerable weak passwords actually are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went through the TryHackMe room on John the Ripper today, and it was like getting a masterclass in offensive security. The scary part? This stuff actually works, and it works fast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hashing: Digital Fingerprints and Password Security</title><link>https://progresslog.me/posts/2025-08-21-progresslog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:05:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://progresslog.me/posts/2025-08-21-progresslog/</guid><description>&lt;p>So after wrapping up public key cryptography yesterday, I jumped straight into hashing today. I thought I had a decent understanding of what hashing was, but wow, was I wrong. This stuff is way more fundamental to cybersecurity than I realized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The TryHackMe room started with a simple question that made me pause: &amp;ldquo;You just downloaded a 6GB file - how do you know it&amp;rsquo;s exactly the same as the original?&amp;rdquo; My first thought was &amp;ldquo;uh, check the file size?&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s obviously not enough. Enter hash values - basically digital fingerprints for data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
