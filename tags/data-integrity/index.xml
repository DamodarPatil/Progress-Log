I thought I had a decent understanding of what hashing was, but wow, was I wrong. This stuff is way more fundamental to cybersecurity than I realized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The TryHackMe room started with a simple question that made me pause: &amp;ldquo;You just downloaded a 6GB file - how do you know it&amp;rsquo;s exactly the same as the original?&amp;rdquo; My first thought was &amp;ldquo;uh, check the file size?&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s obviously not enough. Enter hash values - basically digital fingerprints for data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
