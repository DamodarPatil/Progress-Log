      <title>Hashing: Digital Fingerprints and Password Security</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after wrapping up public key cryptography yesterday, I jumped straight into hashing today. I thought I had a decent understanding of what hashing was, but wow, was I wrong. This stuff is way more fundamental to cybersecurity than I realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TryHackMe room started with a simple question that made me pause: &amp;ldquo;You just downloaded a 6GB file - how do you know it&amp;rsquo;s exactly the same as the original?&amp;rdquo; My first thought was &amp;ldquo;uh, check the file size?&amp;rdquo; But that&amp;rsquo;s obviously not enough. Enter hash values - basically digital fingerprints for data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Public Key Cryptography Finally Clicked</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so remember how I mentioned diving into cryptography yesterday? Well, I decided to tackle the TryHackMe room on public key cryptography, and honestly, my brain feels like it just went through a blender. But in a good way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always heard terms like &amp;ldquo;RSA&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;digital signatures&amp;rdquo; thrown around, but they felt like these mysterious concepts that only math wizards could understand. Turns out, with the right analogies, this stuff actually makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diving into Cryptography - My First Steps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deeper into cybersecurity lately, and one thing that kept coming up everywhere was cryptography. Honestly, I used to think crypto was just for hackers in movies or something super advanced that I&amp;rsquo;d tackle &amp;ldquo;someday.&amp;rdquo; But turns out, this stuff is literally everywhere I look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started a TryHackMe room on crypto basics last week, and it got me thinking - how did we even get to the point where my WhatsApp messages are secure, but the internet itself isn&amp;rsquo;t? That&amp;rsquo;s a weird contradiction, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
