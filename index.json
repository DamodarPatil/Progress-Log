Break down complex concepts into simple explanations. Build a portfolio that shows my growth. Hopefully help others who are starting their own security journey. 📝 Why a Blog? Learning cybersecurity can feel overwhelming — there’s networking, Linux, malware analysis, tools like Wireshark, SIEMs, and much more.\nWriting about it forces me to:\nOrganize my thoughts clearly. Understand topics deeply (teaching is the best way to learn). Track progress and see how far I’ve come. 🚀 What You Can Expect I’ll be posting about things like:\nNetworking basics (OSI, TCP/IP). Linux tips \u0026amp; commands. Security tools (John the Ripper, Hashcat, Wireshark, etc.). Notes from TryHackMe and other labs. My personal reflections and mistakes along the way. 🔒 Final Words This website is not about being perfect — it’s about learning step by step.\nIf you’re on the same path, maybe this blog can help you too.\nThanks for being here 🙌\nStay tuned — this is just the beginning.\n","permalink":"https://damodarpatil.github.io/Progress-Log/posts/welcome/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"-welcome-to-my-blog\"\u003e👋 Welcome to My Blog\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Damodar, and I’ve started this blog to \u003cstrong\u003edocument my journey in cybersecurity\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m currently preparing to become a \u003cstrong\u003eSOC Analyst\u003c/strong\u003e, and instead of just keeping notes on my computer, I wanted a place where I can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShare what I learn daily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBreak down complex concepts into simple explanations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuild a portfolio that shows my growth.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHopefully help others who are starting their own security journey.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-why-a-blog\"\u003e📝 Why a Blog?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning cybersecurity can feel overwhelming — there’s networking, Linux, malware analysis, tools like Wireshark, SIEMs, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting about it forces me to:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Welcome to My Blog"}]
