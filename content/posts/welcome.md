# 👋 Welcome to My Blog

Hey everyone!  
My name is Damodar, and I’ve started this blog to **document my journey in cybersecurity**.  

I’m currently preparing to become a **SOC Analyst**, and instead of just keeping notes on my computer, I wanted a place where I can:  
- Share what I learn daily.  
- Break down complex concepts into simple explanations.  
- Build a portfolio that shows my growth.  
- Hopefully help others who are starting their own security journey.

## 📝 Why a Blog?

Learning cybersecurity can feel overwhelming — there’s networking, Linux, malware analysis, tools like Wireshark, SIEMs, and much more.  
Writing about it forces me to:  
- Organize my thoughts clearly.  
- Understand topics deeply (teaching is the best way to learn).  
- Track progress and see how far I’ve come.

## 🚀 What You Can Expect

I’ll be posting about things like:  
- Networking basics (OSI, TCP/IP).  
- Linux tips & commands.  
- Security tools (John the Ripper, Hashcat, Wireshark, etc.).  
- Notes from TryHackMe and other labs.  
- My personal reflections and mistakes along the way.

## 🔒 Final Words

This website is not about being perfect — it’s about learning **step by step**.  
If you’re on the same path, maybe this blog can help you too.  

Thanks for being here 🙌  
Stay tuned — this is just the beginning.
