The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a conceptual framework that standardizes how different computer systems communicate over a network. It divides communication into **seven layers**, each with specific responsibilities.  

### Why the OSI Model Matters
- Helps **visualize how data flows** through a network  
- Provides a **common language** for networking professionals  
- Useful for **troubleshooting** and identifying issues layer by layer  

### The Seven Layers of OSI
1. **Physical Layer** – Deals with hardware, cables, signals, and bits on the wire  
2. **Data Link Layer** – Ensures reliable node-to-node delivery (e.g., MAC addresses, switches)  
3. **Network Layer** – Handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP addresses, routers)  
4. **Transport Layer** – Provides reliable data delivery (e.g., TCP/UDP)  
5. **Session Layer** – Manages sessions and connections between devices  
6. **Presentation Layer** – Translates data formats, encryption, and compression  
7. **Application Layer** – Closest to the user; apps like browsers, email, and FTP work here  

### Example Flow
Imagine sending a message via WhatsApp:
- You type a message → **Application Layer**
- Message is formatted and encrypted → **Presentation Layer**
- A communication session starts → **Session Layer**
- Data is broken into TCP segments → **Transport Layer**
- Segments are addressed with IP → **Network Layer**
- Packets are framed into Ethernet frames → **Data Link Layer**
- Finally, converted to electrical/optical signals → **Physical Layer**

**Key Takeaway**: The OSI Model is a **map of communication** — every network issue can usually be traced back to one of these seven layers.
