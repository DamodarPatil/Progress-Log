description: "A practical explanation of the TCP/IP Model, its four layers, and how it maps to the OSI Model."

The **TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)** is the foundation of the modern internet. Unlike the OSI Model’s 7 layers, TCP/IP is built around **4 layers**, making it more practical and directly used in real-world networking.  

## Why TCP/IP Matters
- It’s the **actual model used** in the internet and computer networking  
- Defines **protocols** like TCP, IP, HTTP, and DNS  
- Easier to apply in real-world troubleshooting compared to OSI  

## The Four Layers of TCP/IP
1. **Application Layer** – Combines OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP)  
2. **Transport Layer** – Handles reliable delivery and error checking (e.g., TCP, UDP)  
3. **Internet Layer** – Responsible for addressing and routing (e.g., IP, ICMP)  
4. **Network Access Layer** – Covers hardware, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and device drivers (equivalent to OSI’s Data Link + Physical)  

## Mapping OSI to TCP/IP
| OSI Model            | TCP/IP Model        |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Application, Presentation, Session | Application |
| Transport            | Transport |
| Network              | Internet |
| Data Link + Physical | Network Access |

## Example Flow
When you open a website:
- Browser sends an **HTTP request** → Application Layer  
- Request is broken into **TCP segments** → Transport Layer  
- Segments get an **IP address** → Internet Layer  
- Data is sent via **Ethernet/Wi-Fi signals** → Network Access Layer

**Key Takeaway**: TCP/IP is the **real-world implementation**, while OSI is more of a **teaching and troubleshooting framework**. Together, they make networking concepts much easier to understand.
