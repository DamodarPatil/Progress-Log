Hi, I’m **Damodar Patil**. I’m currently on a journey to become a **cybersecurity professional**, with a focus on **Security Operations (SOC) analysis and threat detection**.  

This blog is my **progress log** — a place where I document what I’m learning every day, break down complex concepts into simple notes, and share my experiences in building the skills needed for real-world cybersecurity.  

### What I’m Working On
- Strengthening my **Linux and networking fundamentals**  
- Practicing hands-on labs on **TryHackMe**  
- Learning and using tools like **Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit**  
- Preparing for **CompTIA Security+** as my first certification milestone  

### Why This Blog?
I believe learning sticks best when it’s shared. By writing here, I’m not only creating a knowledge base for myself but also hoping it helps others starting their own cybersecurity journey.
