Hi, I’m Damodar.  

I’m currently building my career in **cybersecurity**, with a strong focus on becoming a **SOC Analyst**. My journey started with curiosity about how systems, networks, and threats actually work behind the scenes. Since then, I’ve been learning step by step — from networking fundamentals and Linux internals to hands-on labs on platforms like TryHackMe.  

I use this blog to document what I’m learning, explain concepts in simple language, and keep track of my progress. Writing here helps me sharpen my understanding and also share knowledge with others starting out in security.  

Outside of cybersecurity, I’m just someone who enjoys exploring new tech, experimenting with Linux, and staying curious.
